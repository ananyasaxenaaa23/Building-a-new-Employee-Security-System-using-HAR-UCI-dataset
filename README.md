## Overview

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

## Data Overview
Accelerometer and gyroscope readings are collected from 30 employees as they complete the 6 activities. Readings are divided into a 2.56 second window with 50% overlap. The accelerometer readings are broken down into readings of gravitational acceleration and body acceleration, which have three X, Y, and Z components. Gyroscope readings are measures of angular velocity that also have X, Y, and Z components.

The jerk signals are calculated from the measured values of body acceleration. After that, all the basic signal values are calculated for each window: mean, maximum, entropy, etc. Then we get a feature vector of 561 features and these features are provided in the dataset.


## Train and Test ratio
30 subjects(*employees*) data is randomly split to __70%__ of the employees were taken as __training data__ and remaining __30%__ subjectsâ€™ recordings were taken for __test data__. 

## Framework
## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)

- Load the fearure.txt file and then train data and test data.
- Find out the total data points and feature count of the train and test data.
```python
features = list()
with open('/content/drive/MyDrive/UCI HAR Dataset-20221223T170042Z-001/UCI HAR Dataset/UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt') as f:
    features = [line.split()[1] for line in f.readlines()]
print('Total Features: {}'.format(len(features)))

```

```
Output: 
(7352, 564) (2947, 564)

```
